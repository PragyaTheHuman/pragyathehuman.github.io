Have you ever thought of poetry as an algorithm, or musical rhythm as a combinatorial puzzle? Ancient Indian scholars did just that—more than two millennia ago! At the heart of this intellectual pursuit lies Chanda???stra, the science of poetic metres, pioneered by Pingala around 300 BCE. This ancient text doesn’t just speak of art—it encodes powerful mathematical and computational concepts that continue to fascinate scholars even today.
Let’s take a journey through some of these mesmerizing ideas.
1. Mathematics Hidden in Metres
Syllables as Binary Elements
In Sanskrit prosody, syllables are classified as:
- Laghu (L) – short, denoted as 1
- Guru (G) – long, denoted as 0

These syllables form the building blocks of poetic metres. When arranged in fixed-length patterns, they resemble binary sequences, where each sequence represents a unique metre.
Prast?ra – Systematic Enumeration
Pingala’s prast?ra is the earliest documented method of listing all binary sequences of a given length—essentially, generating all combinations of L and G. For example, for 3 syllables, the 8 combinations are:
GGG, LGG, GLG, LLG, GGL, LGL, GLL, LLL

This is conceptually similar to what we now call binary trees or truth tables in computer science.
2. The Algorithms of Pingala: Ancient Computational Thinking
Sankhy? – Counting the Possibilities
Pingala introduces an efficient way to compute the number of combinations (metres) of length n, i.e., 2^n, using binary recursion—a method modern-day computer science uses for fast exponentiation.
Na??a – Retrieval without Regeneration
Retrieve a specific row in a prast?ra without generating the full table, using an iterative binary-based method.
Uddi??a – Ranking from Pattern
This determines the position of a known metre in the prast?ra. Equivalent to ranking/unranking algorithms in combinatorics.
Lagakriy? – Counting by Composition
Count how many metres exist with a specific number of Ls or Gs. This links to combinatorics with constraints.
3. Beyond Metres: Rhythm and Melody as Algorithms
M?tra-v?ttas – From Binary to Fibonacci
Unlike var?a-v?ttas (binary syllables), m?tra-v?ttas use time units—L = 1, G = 2. The number of ways to construct a metre of n m?tras follows the Virah??ka sequence, an ancient version of the Fibonacci sequence.
4. T?la-Prast?ra – Mathematical Rhythm
??r?gadeva’s Sa?g?ta-Ratn?kara describes t?la-prast?ra as a rhythmic version of prast?ra, using units of Druta (1), Laghu (2), Guru (4), and Pluta (6).
Enumerating these combinations leads to a custom recurrence: Sn = Sn-1 + Sn-2 + Sn-4 + Sn-6.
5. T?na-Prast?ra – Permutations in Melody
Enumerates all permutations of musical notes (e.g., S, R, G, M) using an algorithm similar to colexicographic ordering.
Kha??a-Meru (factorial triangle) is used to calculate positions and retrieve permutations—conceptually similar to Lehmer codes.
6. Unified Mathematical Theme: Representation of Numbers
Each type of prast?ra represents numbers differently:
- Binary representation in var?a-v?ttas
- Fibonacci numbers in m?tra-v?ttas
- Custom recurrence in t?la-prast?ras
- Factorial number system in t?na-prast?ras
- Binomial coefficients in Ayurveda and perfumery
7. Combinatorics in Ayurveda and Perfumery
Caraka Sa?hit? uses nCr to compute 63 rasa combinations.
Var?hamihira’s Br?hat Sa?hit? lists 1820 perfume combinations (16C4), illustrating early use of Pascal’s triangle (Meru-prast?ra).
Conclusion: The Algorithmic Mind of Ancient India
From poetry to perfumes, ancient Indian thinkers encoded algorithms into their art.
Chanda???stra, T?la, and T?na-prast?ras are not just cultural texts but early experiments in combinatorics, recursion, and number theory.
Revisiting them reveals timeless tools that continue to inspire innovation today.
