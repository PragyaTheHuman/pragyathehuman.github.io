        OpenFoamBased Analysis of Incompressible Flows Over Solid Bodies
       </h3>
       <p> Fluid flow around solid bodies is a common phenomenon in everyday life. The dynamics of external flows are key to understanding the generation of drag and lift forces, which are essential for enhancing the performance and efficiency of various engineering systems. This study focuses on incompressible, steady, and laminar fluid flow over three geometries: a circular cylinder, a square cylinder, and a thin flat plate. The objective is to investigate how changes in velocity and viscosity influence the resulting drag and lift forces.</p>
       <p> Numerical simulations were performed using OpenFOAM. The results were analysed for different Reynolds numbers, and the changes in drag and lift were compared across conditions. </p>
       <p> In bluff bodies, pressure forces dominate over viscous forces. As a result, drag is primarily due to pressure differences, while the contribution from viscous forces is minimal. Lift, however, arises from pressure differences between the upper and lower surfaces due to flow asymmetry. Therefore, changes in fluid viscosity have a minor effect on drag but can significantly impact lift due to changes in the flow structures in the upper and lower surface of the bodies.</p>
       <p> In contrast, streamlined bodies experience minimal pressure differences. For these geometries, drag is mainly caused by viscous shear, and changes in viscosity have a direct and substantial effect on drag. The influence on lift, however, is smaller due to the reduced role of pressure variations.</p>

        Parkinson’s Resting Tremors: A NetLogo-Based Neural Simulation of Dopamine and DBS
       </h3>
        <p> This paper visualises the neural activity during resting tremors and the effects of different treatments using a custom-built agent-based simulation in NetLogo to model a simplified neural resting oscillator. </p>
	<p> Among other symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, this study focuses on Parkinsonian Resting Tremors and investigates two treatments namely Deep Brain Stimulator and an Automatic Dopamine Dosage. Among other compounds effecting tremors, this study looks at dopamine levels as a primary factor for the frequency of tremors. It analyses the effects of treatments when various parameters are changed to observe the efficiency of both the treatments. </p>
	<p> The simulation demonstrates that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is significantly more effective at suppressing Parkinsonian tremors when applied to the thalamic region compared to the cortical region. It also shows that increasing disease severity demands higher dopamine dosage frequency and quantity, with diminishing effectiveness at later stages. </p>

        Bio-Enzymatic Decomposition of Crop Residue: A Scalable Solution to Stubble Burning in India
       </h3>
       <p>
        Stubble burning in Northern India remains a serious environmental and public health concern. This study investigates the potential of bio-enzyme formulations as a scalable, cost-effective alternative for crop residue decomposition. By combining expert interviews, field visits, and controlled experiments using three different bio-enzyme compositions, the study finds that higher concentrations of jaggery and yeast substantially enhance microbial activity and accelerate stubble breakdown. The findings underscore the viability of integrating bio-enzyme use with agricultural machinery and supportive policies, thereby offering a feasible path to reducing reliance on stubble burning.

         Mental Health
        </h3>
        <p>
         Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety are silent yet ever-present, much like shadows in our daily lives. My portfolio seeks to create artwork that resonates with viewers, reflecting the inner turmoil often hidden beneath the surface. As students, we are often subjected to academic pressures, societal expectations, and the constant influence of social media, which can heighten feelings of anxiety and depression. My focus is to explore the concept of “invisible struggles.”  The motivation to explore this theme stems from my desire to raise awareness and challenge the stigma surrounding mental health. Having witnessed its impact on friends and family, I feel a personal connection that drives me to use my art as a platform for awareness. By depicting emotions and situations that are typically concealed, I hope to dismantle the barriers that prevent open discussions around mental health.

         Departure
        </h3>
        <p>
         Departure is often seen as the end of something—a closing chapter, a goodbye, a farewell. But I chose this theme to explore how departure is also a powerful beginning. When we leave one place, situation, or relationship behind, we open ourselves to new journeys, growth, and experiences. This duality of departure, as both an end and a beginning, brings depth to the theme and reflects life’s natural ebb and flow. In my artwork, I aim to illustrate how departure can be bittersweet but is not always sad. Sometimes, leaving is necessary and positive; it allows us to grow, to seek new horizons, and to transform. For example, leaving a comfort zone often leads to discovering one’s true potential, while moving away from familiar surroundings fosters resilience and independence.
