                            <h3>Mental Health</h3>
                            <p>Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety are silent yet ever-present, much like shadows in our daily lives. My portfolio seeks to create artwork that resonates with viewers, reflecting the inner turmoil often hidden beneath the surface. As students, we are often subjected to academic pressures, societal expectations, and the constant influence of social media, which can heighten feelings of anxiety and depression. My focus is to explore the concept of “invisible struggles.”  The motivation to explore this theme stems from my desire to raise awareness and challenge the stigma surrounding mental health. Having witnessed its impact on friends and family, I feel a personal connection that drives me to use my art as a platform for awareness. By depicting emotions and situations that are typically concealed, I hope to dismantle the barriers that prevent open discussions around mental health.</p>

                            <h3>Departure</h3>
                            <p>Departure is often seen as the end of something—a closing chapter, a goodbye, a farewell. But I chose this theme to explore how departure is also a powerful beginning. When we leave one place, situation, or relationship behind, we open ourselves to new journeys, growth, and experiences. This duality of departure, as both an end and a beginning, brings depth to the theme and reflects life’s natural ebb and flow. In my artwork, I aim to illustrate how departure can be bittersweet but is not always sad. Sometimes, leaving is necessary and positive; it allows us to grow, to seek new horizons, and to transform. For example, leaving a comfort zone often leads to discovering one’s true potential, while moving away from familiar surroundings fosters resilience and independence.</p>
